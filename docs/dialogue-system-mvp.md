# Dialogue System MVP vs. Full Implementation

## MVP Definition (End of Sprint 2)

The Minimum Viable Product for our dialogue system will include the essential functionality needed to demonstrate the concept and provide basic usability.

### MVP Components

1. **Core Library**
   - JSON dialogue file loading and parsing
   - Basic dialogue traversal (showing text, navigating between nodes)
   - Simple validation of dialogue structure
   - Clear API for UI layers to consume

2. **Console UI**
   - Text-based display of dialogue
   - Numbered response selection
   - Basic dialogue navigation
   - Reset functionality

3. **Streamlit UI**
   - Simple display of dialogue text and responses
   - Interactive response buttons
   - Basic styling to make it readable
   - File selection for different dialogues

### MVP Features

- Loading a dialogue tree from a JSON file
- Displaying NPC dialogue text
- Showing response options to the user
- Processing user selection and navigating to the next dialogue
- Supporting branching conversation paths
- Working in both console and Streamlit interfaces

### MVP Limitations

- No quest system
- Limited styling (functional but not fully "retro terminal")
- No dialogue history view
- No file upload (only pre-defined file selection)
- Basic error handling
- No debug information
- Limited validation of dialogue trees

## Full Implementation (End of Sprint 4)

The complete implementation will add polish, user conveniences, and additional features that enhance the user experience.

### Additional Features in Full Implementation

1. **Enhanced Core Library**
   - Quest tracking system
   - Script commands for triggering events
   - Comprehensive dialogue tree validation
   - Dialogue history tracking
   - Optimized performance for larger dialogues

2. **Improved Console UI**
   - Quest information display
   - Cleaner formatting
   - Better error messages
   - Command history

3. **Polished Streamlit UI**
   - Complete retro terminal styling
   - Dialogue history view
   - File upload functionality
   - Debug information panel
   - Quest display panel
   - Responsive design

4. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Multiple example dialogue files
   - Comprehensive code documentation
   - User guides for creating dialogue trees

## Development Path

1. **Sprint 1-2: Build MVP**
   - Focus on core functionality and basic interfaces
   - Get the dialogue navigation working in both UIs
   - Ensure JSON parsing is reliable

2. **Sprint 3-4: Enhance to Full Implementation**
   - Add quest system and styling
   - Improve user experience
   - Add conveniences and additional features
   - Polish and optimize

## Benefits of the MVP-First Approach

1. **Early Validation**: Test the core concept with minimal investment
2. **Faster Feedback**: Get user input on the basic functionality before adding complexity
3. **Flexible Prioritization**: Adjust later sprint priorities based on MVP feedback
4. **Risk Reduction**: Identify technical challenges early in the development cycle
5. **Incremental Value**: Deliver a usable product quickly, then enhance over time

This approach ensures we have a working system early in the development cycle while still building toward a rich, full-featured dialogue system.
